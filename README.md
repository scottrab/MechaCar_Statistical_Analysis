## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

The coefficients that provided a non-random amount of variance to predict MPG values are vehicle length, weight, and ground clearance. 
The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero because there is a medium to strong linear relationship in the model to predict MPG.
The linear model has an R-squared value of 71.5% which means that the model can predict MPG with 71.5% accuracy, which is pretty good.
