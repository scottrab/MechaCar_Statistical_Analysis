## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

The coefficients that provided a non-random amount of variance to predict MPG values are vehicle length, weight, and ground clearance. 
The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero because there is a medium to strong linear relationship in the model to predict MPG.
The linear model has an R-squared value of 71.5% which means that the model can predict MPG with 71.5% accuracy, which is pretty good.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
Being that the specifications for the MechaCar desisgn is required to have a variance not exceeding 100 pounds per sqaure inch, we can conclude that both lot1 and lot2 meet the specifications because the variance is below 100.

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition
A statistical study that would compare MechaCar vs competition would be to compare MPG across several models.  The null hypotheses is that price does not dictate MPG. I would perform a linear regression analysis with coefficients including MPG, price, and manufacturer.  After gathering the data for multiple brands, a model can be run to predict price based on MPG.
